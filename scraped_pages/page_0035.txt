Faculty of computer science - OvGU Magdeburg Study Support
Study Support
As an international student, it is not unusual to be overwhelmed by the new education system and feel lost. Under SI@FIN, we provide one-on-one consultation if you are facing difficulties in your studies and looking for guidance.
All you have to do is schedule a meeting with our faculty member using the OVGU e-learning platform. Once you schedule a meeting, you will receive a confirmation email.
