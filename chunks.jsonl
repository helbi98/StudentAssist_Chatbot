Emails today are synonymous with official communication and thus, it needs a little more attention. When you communicate with a professor at a german university, you have a look at the elements of an email. Subject line\nThe subject line should be direct; short and crisp but long enough to explain what the email is for. Example:\n\"Application for a 6 credits project under your supervision during WiSe19\". \"Inquiring about a project in the simulation group during WiSe19\"\n\"Seeking an appointment to discuss <specific_topic>.\""}
